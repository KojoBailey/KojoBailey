<br/>

Welcome! 🙌 My name is **Kojo**, and there are 2 key things I strive to dedicate myself to in life:
1. The design and implementation of **systems** for users, and
2. **Learning** new things and **sharing** knowledge with others.

In pursuing the latter, I hope to develop ways to achieve the former, making use of programming and the power of **computer science**!

🌏 Ethnically, I am from the UK 🇬🇧, Ireland 🇮🇪, Ghana 🇬🇭, and Germany 🇩🇪, and I have lived in Kuala Lumpur 🇲🇾, Ho Chi Minh City 🇻🇳, La Palma 🇪🇸, Belfast 🍀, Doha 🇶🇦, and am currently in my first year at the University of Liverpool 🏫 for Computer Science BSc while my immediate family lives in Chennai 🇮🇳.

Despite this, I only fluently speak English, pero mi español no es terrible y lo estudié en el colegio, and I'm also making efforts to learn both Japanese 🇯🇵 (日本はとても面白い) and Mandarin Chinese 🇨🇳 (我爱中文).

For many years, I used Visual Studio Code, but now use Neovim in PowerShell as my primary code editor. Unfortunately, I'm still tied to Windows (11), but have hopes of switching to Linux once I can afford a new laptop - I currently use an ASUS VivoBook with specs that leave a lot to be desired.

## Languages I've used "properly"
[![Languages I've used](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cpp,haskell,cs,react,godot,lua)](https://skillicons.dev)

![C++ Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-blue?style=flat-square&logo=cplusplus&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![C++ Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/binary%2B%2B-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/binary-cpp-library) [![C++ Example 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/NUCC%2B%2B-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/nucc-cpp-library) [![C++ Example 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/JAPI_XFBIN_Merger-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/JAPI-XFBIN-Merger)

My current "main" language. Started learning it for modding, and have kept developing software in it since, although I'm now looking for modern alternatives.

![Haskell Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Haskell-blue?style=flat-square&logo=haskell&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![Haskell Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Worldle_Solver-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/wordle-solver-hs) [![Haskell Example 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Image_to_ASCII-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/image-to-ascii-hs) [![Haskell Example 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Command_Line_Calculator-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/command-line-calculator-hs)

Introduced in university, a language that isn't particularly easy to use but is fascinating to learn about and weirdly fun all the same.

![C# Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-blue?style=flat-square&logo=unity&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![C# Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shin_SvZ-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/Shin-Samurai-vs-Zombies-Defence) [![C# Example 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/SvZ2_Kaizen-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/SvZ2-Kaizen)

Learned solely for modding and creating games in [Unity](https://unity.com/), but I have my eyes on it for GUI development as an alternative to C++.

![React Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-blue?style=flat-square&logo=react&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![React Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/jojomodding.com-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/JoJosBizarreModdingCommunity/JoJosBizarreModdingCommunity.github.io)

My go-to for actual web development, first learned when creating [jojomodding.com](https://jojomodding.com/), although I'm yet to explore other options.

![GDScript Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/GDScript-blue?style=flat-square&logo=godotengine&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![GDScript Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/SvZ2_Wave_Editor-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/svz2-wave-editor)

[Godot](https://godotengine.org/)'s custom language, I find it interesting for its syntactic similarity to Python.

![Lua Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lua-blue?style=flat-square&logo=lua&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![Lua Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Module:Ref-blue?style=flat-square)](https://jojowiki.com/Module:Ref) [![Lua Example 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Module:Upgrade_Table-blue?style=flat-square)](https://svzdefense.wiki.gg/wiki/Module:Upgrade_Table) [![Lua Example 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Module:File_Info-blue?style=flat-square)](https://plantsvszombies.wiki.gg/wiki/Module:File_Info)

First exposed to by [Roblox](https://create.roblox.com/), but later used for many MediaWiki modules via [Scribunto](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Scribunto). Also use it for Neovim, but that hardly counts.

## Languages I've dabbled with
[![Languages I've dabbled with](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c,windows,rust,python,javascript,typescript,java)](https://skillicons.dev)

![C Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-blue?style=flat-square&logo=c&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

Although useful to learn, I haven't had much reason to use it over C++, and typically only have to work with it in actual projects when doing C-interop. I've also worked with C-like pseudocode when reverse engineering. Ultimately, I imagine that it's better to just... code C-style in C++ anyway, since C++ does genuinely bring improvements in many areas, even if you don't fancy OOP (which you are not forced to use).

![x86 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/x86_assembly-blue?style=flat-square&logo=cashapp&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![Assembly Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Algorithms_in_ASM-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/algorithms-asm)

Although I'm not making a fully-fledged app in it anytime soon, it's fun learning it for the sake of also learning more about low-level processes, which are useful in both software development and  reverse engineering.

![Rust Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-blue?style=flat-square&logo=rust&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![Rust Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Algorithms_in_Rust-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/algorithms-rs)

Quite frankly, I think C++'s flaws are too great to be fixed, and the programming space would benefit from a fresh start. That's why I'm rooting for Rust, as not only is it gaining popularity rapidly, but it's full of interesting design philosophies. In particular, I'm captivated by its relationship to Haskell and functional programming in general.

![Python Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-blue?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![Python Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Number_Guesser-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/number-guesser-py)

Despite its popularity, I haven't at all needed it in my projects so far.

![JavaScript Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-blue?style=flat-square&logo=javascript&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![JavaScript Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Anki_Language_Card_Templates-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/anki-language-card-templates)

The scripting language of the web, I've mostly used it for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) templates, of all things. I have used React JSX, but I suppose it is different enough to separate.

![TypeScript Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-blue?style=flat-square&logo=typescript&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

JavaScript with static type checking! I'm currently using this in React TSX to develop a website.

![Java Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-blue?style=flat-square&logo=coffeescript&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

I'm now learning it in university, but am yet to do anything particularly interesting with it. My personal interest in the language lies in its failure as a replacement for C++.

## Languages I'm eager to try
![OCaml Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OCaml-blue?style=flat-square&logo=ocaml&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

This stands out to me for appearing to be a more practical Haskell, although I'm yet to confirm that. I do like a multi-paradigm language.

![Zig Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zig-blue?style=flat-square&logo=zig&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

Although I do like OOP, I'm curious to try a language without it that is imperative and isn't C. I also like that it prioritises interopability with C, and its focus on memory control over Rust's memory safety may also be interesting to compare.

![Carbon Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carbon-blue?style=flat-square&logo=google&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

Although still experimental, I'm very curious to see how this project compares not only to C++, but to Rust as well, as the latter would likely be its biggest competitor.

![Go Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-blue?style=flat-square&logo=go&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

To be honest, I know very little of Go and its usefulness, but I do know it was built by Google, so it's got to be interesting.

![Verse Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Verse-blue?style=flat-square&logo=unrealengine&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

Epic Games's new language for [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) as an alternative to C++, more suited for the demands of game development! Very interesting indeed.

![Ruby](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ruby-blue?style=flat-square&logo=ruby&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

Not even sure how I came across Ruby, but given how its syntax is so different from other languages, I'm very interested in trying it out.

![Curry](https://img.shields.io/badge/Curry-blue?style=flat-square&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

An extension of Haskell that makes it multi-paradigm, I must try it out sometime.

![Fortran](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fortran-blue?style=flat-square&logo=fortran&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

The first high-level language ever created! On first glance, it looked nothing like I expected (which was for it to just be a simpler C), and I HAVE to try out its seemingly maths-based type system (e.g. "Real"s instead of "Float"s).

![Lisp](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lisp-blue?style=flat-square&logo=commonlisp&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

The second high-level language ever created, and it's... functional??? Well, it certainly incorporates concepts from functional programming, and I'm honestly just shocked that the world's 2nd language wasn't just a Fortran clone.
