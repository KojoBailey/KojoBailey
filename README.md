<br/>

Welcome! 🙌 My name is **Kojo**, and there are 2 key things I strive to dedicate myself to in life:
1. The design and implementation of **systems** for users, and
2. **Learning** new things and **sharing** knowledge with others.

In pursuing the latter, I hope to develop ways to achieve the former, making use of programming and the power of **computer science**!

🌏 Ethnically, I am from the UK 🇬🇧, Ireland 🇮🇪, Ghana 🇬🇭, and Germany 🇩🇪, and I have lived in Kuala Lumpur 🇲🇾, Ho Chi Minh City 🇻🇳, La Palma 🇪🇸, Belfast 🍀, Doha 🇶🇦, and am currently in my first year at the University of Liverpool 🏫 for Computer Science BSc while my immediate family lives in Chennai 🇮🇳.

Despite this, I only fluently speak English, pero mi español no es terrible y lo estudié en el colegio, and I'm also making efforts to learn both Japanese 🇯🇵 (日本はとても面白い) and Mandarin Chinese 🇨🇳 (我爱中文).

## Languages I've used "properly"
![C++ Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-blue?style=flat-square&logo=cplusplus&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![C++ Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/binary%2B%2B-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/binary-cpp-library) [![C++ Example 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/NUCC%2B%2B-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/nucc-cpp-library) [![C++ Example 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/JAPI_XFBIN_Merger-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/JAPI-XFBIN-Merger)

My current "main" language. Started learning for modding, and have kept developing software in it since.

![Haskell Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Haskell-blue?style=flat-square&logo=haskell&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![Haskell Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Worldle_Solver-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/wordle-solver-hs) [![Haskell Example 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Command_Line_Calculator-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/command-line-calculator-hs)

Introduced in university, a language that isn't particularly easy to use but is fascinating to learn about and weirdly fun all the same.

![C# Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-blue?style=flat-square&logo=unity&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![C# Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shin_SvZ-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/Shin-Samurai-vs-Zombies-Defence)

Learned solely for modding and creating games in [Unity](https://unity.com/), but I have my eyes on it for GUI development as an alternative to C++.

![React Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-blue?style=flat-square&logo=react&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![React Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/jojomodding.com-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/JoJosBizarreModdingCommunity/JoJosBizarreModdingCommunity.github.io)

My go-to for actual web development, first learned when creating [jojomodding.com](https://jojomodding.com/), although I'm yet to explore other options.

![Lua Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lua-blue?style=flat-square&logo=lua&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![Lua Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Module:Ref-blue?style=flat-square)](https://jojowiki.com/Module:Ref) [![Lua Example 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Module:Upgrade_Table-blue?style=flat-square)](https://svzdefense.wiki.gg/wiki/Module:Upgrade_Table) [![Lua Example 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Module:File_Info-blue?style=flat-square)](https://plantsvszombies.wiki.gg/wiki/Module:File_Info)

First exposed to by [Roblox](https://create.roblox.com/), but later used for many MediaWiki modules via [Scribunto](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Scribunto).

## Languages I've dabbled with
![C Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-blue?style=flat-square&logo=c&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

Although useful to learn, I haven't had much reason to use it over C++, and typically only have to work with it in actual projects when doing C-interop. I've also worked with C-like pseudocode when reverse engineering.

![Python Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-blue?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![Python Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Number_Guesser-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/number-guesser-py)

Despite its popularity, I haven't at all needed it in my projects so far.

![JavaScript Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-blue?style=flat-square&logo=javascript&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048) [![JavaScript Example 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Anki_Language_Card_Templates-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/KojoBailey/anki-language-card-templates)

The scripting language of the web, I've mostly used it for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) templates, of all things. I have used React JSX, but I suppose it is different enough to separate.

![x86 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/x86_assembly-blue?style=flat-square&logo=cashapp&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

Although I've been motivated to learn it for reverse engineering, I'm yet to have strong motivation to write anything beyond a "Hello, world!" program in it.

## Languages I'm eager to try
![Rust Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-blue?style=flat-square&logo=rust&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

Besides being hailed as the great replacement for C++, I'm also interested in Rust for its ties to Haskell and functional programming in general.

![OCaml Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OCaml-blue?style=flat-square&logo=ocaml&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

This also stands out to me for appearing to be a more practical Haskell, although I'm yet to confirm that. I do like a multi-paradigm language.

![Zig Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zig-blue?style=flat-square&logo=zig&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

Although I do like OOP, I'm curious to try a language without it that is imperative and isn't C. I also like that it prioritises interopability with C, and its focus on memory control over Rust's memory safety may also be interesting to compare.

![Java Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-blue?style=flat-square&logo=coffeescript&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

Coming up in my university course anyway, but I'm interested to check out one of if not the biggest "C++ replacements" before Rust came along.

![Carbon Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carbon-blue?style=flat-square&logo=google&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

Although still experimental, I'm very curious to see how this project compares not only to C++, but to Rust as well, as the latter would likely be its biggest competitor.

![Go Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-blue?style=flat-square&logo=go&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

To be honest, I know very little of Go and its usefulness, but I do know it was built by Google, so it's got to be interesting.

![Verse Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Verse-blue?style=flat-square&logo=unrealengine&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

Epic Games's new language for [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) as an alternative to C++, more suited for the demands of game development! Very interesting indeed.

![GDScript Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/GDScript-blue?style=flat-square&logo=godotengine&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

Similar to Verse, GDScript is [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)'s custom language, although more similar to Python, which I find interesting.

![Ruby](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ruby-blue?style=flat-square&logo=ruby&logoColor=white&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

Not even sure how I came across Ruby, but given how its syntax is so different from other languages, I'm very interested in trying it out.

![Curry](https://img.shields.io/badge/Curry-blue?style=flat-square&labelColor=%23222222&color=%23fe0048)

An extension of Haskell that makes it multi-paradigm, I must try it out sometime.
