- 🔭 Working on videogame modding tools and DLL/API plugins.
- 🌱 Building proficiency in C++ as my "main" language (for now).
- 🎮 Developing my own fangames and mods in Unity with C#.
- 🌐 Nurturing love-hate relationship with web dev.
- 🏫 Studying Haskell in university and out of interest for functional programming.
- 👀 Keen to try out Rust, and maybe OCaml too...
- 📫 Reach me via Discord `@kojobailey`. Better if you join [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/GEGbcRn) so we have a mutual server to then DM each other.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kojobailey) where I post a variety of content related to my projects!

### Languages I've actively used in projects
[![Languages I've used](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cpp,haskell,unity,javascript,react,lua)](https://skillicons.dev)

- **C++** → My current "main" language. Started learning for modding, and have kept developing software in it since.
- **Haskell** → Introduced in university, a language that isn't particularly easy to use but is fascinating to learn about and weirdly fun all the same.
- **C#** → Learned solely for modding and creating games in [Unity](https://unity.com/), but I have my eyes on it for GUI development as an alternative to C++.
- **JavaScript** → The scripting language of the web, I've mostly used it for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) templates, of all things.
- **React JSX** → My go-to for actual web development, first learned when creating [jojomodding.com](https://jojomodding.com/), although I'm yet to explore other options.
- **Lua** → First exposed to by [Roblox](https://create.roblox.com/), but later used for many MediaWiki modules via [Scribunto](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Scribunto).

### Languages I've only dabbled with
[![Languages I've dabbled with](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c,py,x86)](https://skillicons.dev)

- **C** → Although useful to learn, I haven't had much reason to use it over C++, and typically only have to work with it in actual projects when doing C-interop. I've also worked with C-like pseudocode when reverse engineering.
- **Python** → Despite its popularity, I haven't at all needed it in my projects so far.
- **x86 assembly** → Although I've been motivated to learn it for reverse engineering, I'm yet to have strong motivation to write anything beyond a "Hello, world!" program in it.

### Languages I want to try
[![Languages to try](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=rust,ocaml,zig,java,carbon,go)](https://skillicons.dev)

- **Rust** → Besides being hailed as the great replacement for C++, I'm also interested in Rust for its ties to Haskell and functional programming in general.
- **OCaml** → This also stands out to me for appearing to be a more practical Haskell, although I'm yet to confirm that. I do like a multi-paradigm language.
- **Zig** → Although I do like OOP, I'm curious to try a language without it that is imperative and isn't C. I also like that it prioritises interopability with C, and its focus on memory control over Rust's memory safety may also be interesting to compare.
- **Java** → Coming up in my university course anyway, but I'm interested to check out one of if not the biggest "C++ replacements" before Rust came along.
- **Carbon** → Although still experimental, I'm very curious to see how this project compares not only to C++, but to Rust as well, as the latter would likely be its biggest competitor.
- **Go** → To be honest, I know very little of Go and its usefulness, but I do know it was built by Google, so it's got to be interesting.
