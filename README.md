<br/>

Welcome! My name is Kojo, and there are 2 things I aim to dedicate myself to:
1. the design and implementation of systems to the convenience and reduced stress of users, as well as
2. the perpetual journey of learning new things and sharing useful and interesting teachings with others.

In pursuing the latter, I hope to figure out ways to achieve the former, making use of programming and the power of **computer science**!

I am currently...
- 🔭 Working on videogame modding tools and DLL/API plugins.
- 🌱 Building proficiency in C++ as my "main" language (for now).
- 🎮 Developing my own fangames and mods in Unity with C#.
- 🌐 Nurturing love-hate relationship with web dev.
- 🏫 Studying Haskell in university and out of interest for functional programming.
- 👀 Keen to try out Rust, and maybe OCaml too...
- 📫 Reach me via Discord `@kojobailey`. Better if you join [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/GEGbcRn) so we have a mutual server to then DM each other.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kojobailey) where I post a variety of content related to my projects!

### Languages I've actively used in projects
[![Languages I've used](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cpp,haskell,unity,javascript,react,lua)](https://skillicons.dev)

- **C++** → My current "main" language. Started learning for modding, and have kept developing software in it since.
- **Haskell** → Introduced in university, a language that isn't particularly easy to use but is fascinating to learn about and weirdly fun all the same.
- **C#** → Learned solely for modding and creating games in [Unity](https://unity.com/), but I have my eyes on it for GUI development as an alternative to C++.
- **JavaScript** → The scripting language of the web, I've mostly used it for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) templates, of all things.
- **React JSX** → My go-to for actual web development, first learned when creating [jojomodding.com](https://jojomodding.com/), although I'm yet to explore other options.
- **Lua** → First exposed to by [Roblox](https://create.roblox.com/), but later used for many MediaWiki modules via [Scribunto](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Scribunto).

### Languages I've only dabbled with
[![Languages I've dabbled with](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c,py,x86)](https://skillicons.dev)

- **C** → Although useful to learn, I haven't had much reason to use it over C++, and typically only have to work with it in actual projects when doing C-interop. I've also worked with C-like pseudocode when reverse engineering.
- **Python** → Despite its popularity, I haven't at all needed it in my projects so far.
- **x86 assembly** → Although I've been motivated to learn it for reverse engineering, I'm yet to have strong motivation to write anything beyond a "Hello, world!" program in it.

### Languages I want to try
[![Languages to try](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=rust,ocaml,zig,java,carbon,go)](https://skillicons.dev)

- **Rust** → Besides being hailed as the great replacement for C++, I'm also interested in Rust for its ties to Haskell and functional programming in general.
- **OCaml** → This also stands out to me for appearing to be a more practical Haskell, although I'm yet to confirm that. I do like a multi-paradigm language.
- **Zig** → Although I do like OOP, I'm curious to try a language without it that is imperative and isn't C. I also like that it prioritises interopability with C, and its focus on memory control over Rust's memory safety may also be interesting to compare.
- **Java** → Coming up in my university course anyway, but I'm interested to check out one of if not the biggest "C++ replacements" before Rust came along.
- **Carbon** → Although still experimental, I'm very curious to see how this project compares not only to C++, but to Rust as well, as the latter would likely be its biggest competitor.
- **Go** → To be honest, I know very little of Go and its usefulness, but I do know it was built by Google, so it's got to be interesting.
